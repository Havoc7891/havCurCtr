===============
1. What it does
===============
A WinForms-based background app that registers a global hotkey and centers the mouse cursor on the primary monitor when pressed.

===============
2. Requirements
===============
- Windows 10 or later
- .NET 8 Desktop Runtime (x64)

If you don't already have the .NET 8 Desktop Runtime, download and install from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime

=============
3. How to run
=============
1) Extract the ZIP anywhere (e.g., C:\Apps\havCurCtr).
2) Run havCurCtr.exe (No admin required).
3) Look for the tray icon. Use Win + Shift + C to center the cursor.

================================
4. Start with Windows (Optional)
================================
Option A - Startup folder (Per-user)
- Press Win + R -> type: shell:startup -> OK
- Place a shortcut to havCurCtr.exe in that folder

Option B - Registry (Per-user)
Create a file named 'havCurCtr-Startup.reg' with the content below, edit the path, then double-click to add:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run]
"havCurCtr"="\"C:\\Apps\\havCurCtr\\havCurCtr.exe\""

============
5. Tray menu
============
Right-click the tray icon for About / Exit.

=========================
6. Customizing the hotkey
=========================
The hotkey is compiled in. To change it:
- Edit Program.cs -> HOTKEY_MODIFIERS / HOTKEY_VK
- Rebuild (Release): dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishReadyToRun=true

========
7. Notes
========
- Uses a global system-wide hotkey; if Win + Shift + C is taken, the app shows an error.
- No elevation required. Works in the user session.

============
8. Uninstall
============
- Exit from the tray -> delete the app folder.
- If you enabled auto-start: remove the shortcut from shell:startup or delete the 'havCurCtr' value from:
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

==================
9. Troubleshooting
==================
- Hotkey doesn't work: Another app may own the combo. Pick a different hotkey and rebuild.
- No tray icon: Make sure Windows hasn't hidden it; expand the tray overflow.
- Multi-monitor: Centers on the primary monitor by design.
